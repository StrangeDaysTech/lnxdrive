//! Cloud provider port (driven/secondary port)
//!
//! This module defines the interface for interacting with cloud storage
//! providers. The primary implementation targets Microsoft OneDrive via
//! the Microsoft Graph API, but the trait is designed to be provider-agnostic
//! to support future multi-provider scenarios.
//!
//! ## Design Notes
//!
//! - Uses `anyhow::Result` because errors at port boundaries are adapter-specific
//!   and don't need domain-level classification.
//! - Uses `#[async_trait]` for async trait methods.
//! - The `DeltaItem` struct is a port-level DTO, not a domain entity;
//!   use cases are responsible for mapping it to `SyncItem`.

// T052: ICloudProvider trait

/// Port trait for cloud storage provider operations
///
/// This is the primary interface for all interactions with the cloud storage

/// rate limiting, and error mapping.
///
/// ## Implementation Notes
///
/// - Implementations should handle retry logic for transient errors internally
///   or propagate them as `anyhow::Error` for the use case layer to handle.
/// - The `progress` callback in `upload_file_session` is called with
///   `(bytes_sent, total_bytes)` to report upload progress.
/// - All methods assume that valid authentication tokens are available;
///   token refresh should be handled by the implementation or a wrapper.
