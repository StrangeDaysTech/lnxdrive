This project requires all contributors to sign a **Contributor License Agreement (CLA)** before their pull requests can be merged. We use [CLA Assistant](https://cla-assistant.io/) to manage this process.

### How it works

1. When you open your first pull request, CLA Assistant will automatically post a comment asking you to sign the CLA.
2. Click the link in the comment to review and sign the agreement.
3. The CLA only needs to be signed once — it covers all future contributions to this project.
4. Once signed, CLA Assistant will update the PR check status and your contribution can proceed to review.

- Use fenced code blocks with language identifiers
- Use tables for structured data
- Keep lines under 120 characters when practical
- Use blank lines to separate sections

### YAML Front-matter

```yaml
---
id: TYPE-YYYY-MM-DD-NNN
title: Clear, descriptive title
status: draft | accepted | deprecated
created: YYYY-MM-DD
# Additional fields as needed
---
```

### File Naming

DevTrail documents:
```
[TYPE]-[YYYY-MM-DD]-[NNN]-[description].md
```

- Use lowercase for description
- Use hyphens to separate words
- Keep descriptions concise but clear

### Code in Scripts

- Use clear variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Follow shell/PowerShell best practices

---

## Documentation Standards

### Adding a New Document Type

If you're proposing a new document type:

1. **Create the template**
   - Add `TEMPLATE-NEWTYPE.md` to `dist/.devtrail/templates/`
   - Follow existing template patterns

2. **Update governance docs**
   - `dist/.devtrail/00-governance/DOCUMENTATION-POLICY.md`
   - `dist/.devtrail/00-governance/AGENT-RULES.md`
   - `dist/.devtrail/QUICK-REFERENCE.md`

3. **Update agent configs**
   - `dist/dist-templates/directives/` (distribution templates)

4. **Update validation**
   - `dist/scripts/pre-commit-docs.sh`
   - `dist/scripts/validate-docs.ps1`
   - `dist/.github/workflows/docs-validation.yml`

5. **Document the change**
   - Create an ADR explaining the new type
   - Update the README if needed

### Writing Templates

Templates should include:

- Complete YAML front-matter with all fields
- Clear section headers
- Placeholder text explaining what goes in each section
- Examples where helpful

### Writing Governance Documents

- Be clear and unambiguous
- Use tables for reference information
- Include examples
- Keep rules actionable

cd cli
cargo build
```

### Running Tests
